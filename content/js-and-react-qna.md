- [ ] **Event Loop**: Explain and simulate the output of a given event loop scenario.

#### Arrays

- [ ] **Array Rotation**: Rotate an array by `k` positions.
- [ ] **Max Subarray Sum**: Find the maximum sum of a subarray using Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm.
- [ ] **Two-Pointer**: Find all pairs in an array that sum up to a specific target.
- [ ] **Sort 0s, 1s, 2s**: Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s without extra space.
- [ ] **Sliding Window**: Find the longest substring without repeating characters.
- [ ] **Max Subarray Sum (k)**: Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.

#### Strings

- [ ] **Flattening Objects**: Flatten a deeply nested object into a single-level object.
- [ ] **Frequency Count**: Count the frequency of characters or elements in an array or string.

#### Practical Applications

- [ ] **Pagination**: Write a function to paginate an array based on page number and size.
- [ ] **Debouncing**: Implement a debounce function to optimize search inputs.
- [ ] **Throttling**: Implement a throttle function to limit API calls.

#### Miscellaneous
